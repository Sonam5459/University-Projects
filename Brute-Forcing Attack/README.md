This report includes different types of brute-forcing attacks using tools such as Hydra (generating custom password lists), John The Ripper (to get the password using hash), and dirb (Directory Buster) to crawl over some commonly used webpages. It also shows how a simple cipher like Caesarian cipher can be used to make data look like garbled words, and how easy is to decipher such weak ciphers.
